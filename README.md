# ArcPy-Samples
Python scripts which utilize the ArcPy site package.

**Demonstrates**

***ArcPy paradigms***
* Use of ArcPy to create a polygon feature class.
* Nested for-loops and trigonometry to accurately determine the spatial extent of a feature class.
* Use of the Search, Insert, and Update Cursor's provided by the ArcPy site package
* SQL statements to filter results of functions
* Use of a Python Add-In and how to utilize the provided event functions
* Use of ArcPy Describe objects to report metadata about dataset's and feature classes


***Python paradigms***
* Use of nested cursor's to iterate through a table and make logical decisions/changes.
* Use of a custom class and functions to compartmentalize functionality
* Use of the glob, os, and beautiful soup modules
* Error checking to ensure that the script will run properly on any system, and report issues in a useful manner
* Effective reporting for describing the bug-fix to Esri's development team
* Use of a dict as an associative array, providing a visually appealing solution to replacing one query with another
* Expressive debugging statements to inform user as to the progress of the script as it runs
* Creation of new data to prevent unnecessary overwriting of previous data (safely run the script!)
