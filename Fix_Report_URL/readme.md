# Repair URL's from Esri's Report Designer HTM/HTML output
This script repairs the erroneous ```<a>``` tag's created by the Report Designer, if hyperlinks are enabled.

If you're creating a report and saving it as an HTM or HTML file, the <a> tags will look like this:
```html
<a href="True"><nobr>http://www.esri.com/</nobr></a></span>
```
This creates a hyperlink using the URL, but that link leads to a non-existent file call "True".

This script will repair those links, and remove the redacted <nobr> tags, making the URL's function correctly.

Occasionally the user will want to make a Table of Contents HTM file in conjunction with the report. This script will detect that TOC file as long as it has the same name as the report HTM file, and update the links in that TOC file to utilize the repaired HTML file.

## Caveats
* This script requires the Beautiful Soup 4 module, found here:
        http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download
  From that zip file, move the "bs4" folder into the following directory:
        C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.x\Lib\site-packages
* This script could potentially run just fine with any HTM file, so verify that you are using it to correct HTM or HTML files created with the Report Designer.

## How can I run this?
This runs as a standalone script in any Python IDE, using Python 2 from Esri.

Before running the script, update the input_htm and output_html variables, seen in the code below:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    '''Input Parameters:
        :input_hml -- file name and location of the HTM file to be corrected
        :output_html -- file name and location of the HTML file to be created'''
    input_htm = "YOUR_HTM_FILE_PATH_HERE"
    output_html = "DESIRED_HTML_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH_HERE"
    fix_report_urls(input_htm, output_html)
    fix_table_of_contents(input_htm, output_html)
```
