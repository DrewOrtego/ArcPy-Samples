    DESCRIPTION:
    This script repairs the erroneous <a> tag's created by the Report
    Designer, if hyperlinks are enabled.

    PREREQUISTES:
    This script requires the Beautiful Soup 4 module, found here:
        http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download

    Also required is an HTM or HTML file created by Esri's Report Designer, with
    hyperlinks enabled.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        :input_hml -- file name and location of the HTM file to be corrected
        :output_html -- file name and location of the HTML file to be created

    OUTPUT:
    An .html file with the same appearance as the .htm file, but with working
    hyperlinks. (Assuming the URL is correct.)'''
