**Demonstrates**
* Use of the Search, Insert, and Update Cursor's provided by the ArcPy site package.
* Use of nested cursor's to iterate through a table and make logical decisions/changes.
* SQL statements to filter results of each demo.

**Usage:**

    The documentation in the script's themselves explain each script's purpose. For the Search, 
    Insert, and Update Cursors, be sure to run the scripts in the same directory as the 
    "Cursor Demo.gdb" file geodatabase. For using the Embedded_Cursor_Demo.py script,
    include the "Embedded_Cursor_Demo.gdb" geodatabase in the directory you execute 
    the script from.
    
**Purpose:**

    I typically send these scripts to customers who are getting started with ArcPy for 
    the first time, and want to know how to iterate through a table used in ArcMap or 
    ArcCatalog. They have been well-recieved!
    
**Work Flow:**

    Each script makes simple changes to a table in a file geodatabase.
    
**Input:**

    N/A. Running each script as-is will be sufficient. Ensure that the scripts and File 
    Geodatabase files are all in the same directory to effectively run the scripts.
    
**Output:**

    The Insert Cursor demo will insert a new row into the table, while the Update Cursor 
    demo will delete that row. The Embedded Cursor demo will replace specific characters
    in a table. All changes are reported in the Python console.
