#ArcPy-Samples/Cursor-Demo
Demonstrates use of the Search, Insert, and Update Cursor's provided by the ArcPy site package, as well as a demonstration with nested cursor's. Test data provided in two File Geodatabase's.

##Usage:
The documentation in the script's themselves explain each script's purpose. For the Search, Insert, and Update Cursors, be sure to run the scripts in the same directory as the "Cursor Demo.gdb" file geodatabase. For using the Embedded_Cursor_Demo.py script, include the "Embedded_Cursor_Demo.gdb" geodatabase in the directory you execute the script from.

I typically send these scripts to customers who are getting started with ArcPy for the first time, and want to know how to iterate through a table used in ArcMap or ArcCatalog.
